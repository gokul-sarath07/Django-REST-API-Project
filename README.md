# Vernacular.ai Project

## Packages Used
- Django
- Django Multiselectfield
- Django Restframework

### To Run Server, To Create Docker Image and Docker Container
- Run `docker-compose up`
- Docker Image Size: `228.29 MB`
- After build is complete, Navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to view website.

### Insights
- Choose an API (Room or Age).
- Select Form Input to input data (NEXT "ID" IS `9` FOR BOTH).
- Select View Output to view output in API View.
- Note: The database already contains some data. So if you click (Room or Age) output, you can see them in API View.

### Assumptions Made
- For the first API (Room API), The inputs I collect from the user are an id, values (which consist of id types) and pick_first (boolean value, default=False).
- For the second API (Age API), The inputs I collect from the user are an id, values (which consist of different ages), pick_first (boolean value, default=False) and Constraint value (Boolean value which desides if their is a constraint or not, default=False, which means no constraints).
- I wasn't sure if i needed to add the docker image file, so i didn't add it.
- I wasn't sure if i needed to deploy this project to a server, so i didn't deploy it.
